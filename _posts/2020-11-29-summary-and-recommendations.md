The last week of daily blogging is over. Only one post left for tomorrow which will be kind of a "what I learned from this" post. So further thoughts on daily blogging in that post. ðŸ˜‰

This week, I had some trouble coming up with good topics. On Monday and Tuesday, I had long days at work, so I started the week with two short posts about [cold showers](/2020/11/23/cold-showers/) and [climbing](/2020/11/24/climbing-my-favorite-sport/). On Wednesday, I posted about some [iPhone and iPad apps that I use](/2020/11/25/state-of-the-apps/) which was way more work than I had anticipated. On Tuesday, I wrote a follow-up post for last week's [The Voice Inside Your Head](/2020/11/21/the-voice-inside-your-head/), titled [Who Are You?](/2020/11/26/who-are-you/) It is definitely a very deep topic. On Friday, I made a list of [potential travel destinations for 2021](/2020/11/27/2021-travel-destinations/), in case it is possible to travel again, and yesterday I finally wrote somewhat of a [review of the iPhone 12 mini](/2020/11/28/the-iPhone-12-mini/), including some photos I have taken with it (someone asked for cat pics in the comments before, there you go).

Here are some recommendations for this week:

- On Monday, I learned that Taiwan has a Digital Minister called Audrey Tang, and they are such an interesting person. You can read up on them on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang).
- A short 2:14 review of the M1 MacBook Air: [Quick & Dirty Review of the MacBook Air with M1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7-7YE33PsU)
- Yes Theory published a new video where Thomas went to Afghanistan for 96 hours. Highly recommended watch: [96 Hours Inside Afghanistan in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J74B2jzr8iA)
- A funny and pretty interesting article about "comma ellipses": [Why Do Young People Use Commas So Weirdly?](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/comma-ellipses)
- A new Better Ideas video about gratitude: [Why it's so hard to be happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQoS_S9K464)
- My friend Igor posted a new video as well (as always in German): [Mt. Fuji & das japanische Nachtleben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDtfQRsEAHI)
- In Wednesday's post, I mentioned that I'm interested in a new app called "Craft". It is a native iOS and macOS application that works somewhat like Notion. Today I found that MacStories reviewed it: [Craft Review: A Powerful, Native Notes and Collaboration App](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/craft-review-a-powerful-native-notes-and-collaboration-app/)
- [Meanwhile in Finland](https://youtu.be/tPdVXwBI35w)

As always, enjoy your Sunday! One last post tomorrow. Of course, I hopefully won't stop posting completely, but I definitely need a break as the second half of this month of daily blogging has worn me out a bit. ðŸ˜…
