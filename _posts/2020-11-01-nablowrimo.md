Well, it's been a while! Almost a year. I've been wanting to get back to writing blog posts, and I thought why not challenge myself to write a post a day for a month? You might have heard of NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) which is usually in November if I remember correctly, so I thought I'd make NaBloWriMo (National Blog Writing Month) out of that. Apparently, it's not something new, even though according to the Twitter account with almost no followers, NoBloWriMo is set in October instead. Well, whatever. ðŸ¤·

A lot has change in the world since my last post. Way more than anyone could have expected. We're now living in a pandemic, currently in its second wave here in Europe. I'm very lucky to have a job that is both secure and that I can do from home. In fact, I've been working from home ever since I've been back from Japan in March 2020, and it looks like it will continue for a while. I hope you, dear reader, are doing reasonably well, too!

To be honest though, I don't plan to talk much or at all about the pandemic or politics (there's an important election coming up that even I couldn't avoid). Rather, I simply want to write about what I've been up to recently and what my plans are for the not so distant future (I hope). The main purpose for me is to practice writing and develop a habit of writing daily. Actually, I've been writing daily journal entries in English for a while now, but since they are personal, I don't put much effort into making the language sound good and stuff. So I'm using this as an excuse to start a habit of writing publicly.

As a teaser, here are some things that I will likely touch upon this month:
- new iPhones
- anime
- books
- working hours and time management
- making YouTube videos
- probably lots of random nerdy tech stuff

Right now, there is no real feedback mechanism for this blog, so I'm still considering if it makes sense to set something up. It's not like I have many or any readers, but I think getting some feedback, even if it's only from people I already know, would be very helpful. Let me know if you have any ideas ([Contact](/contact)!
