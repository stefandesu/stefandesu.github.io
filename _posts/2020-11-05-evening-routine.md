After yesterday's post about my morning routine, I also want to talk about my evening routine. I usually start winding down between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m., so it's still fairly early. First, I'm writing a journal entry. I'm actually more consistent with this now than I have ever been before, I think. Probably because I can't travel and am therefore always at home. ðŸ˜… Then I usually look for things to clean up (like dishes, or stuff in my room), followed by flossing and brushing my teeth. Now it's between 8:45 and 9:00 and I start my evening reading session. I emphasized in the last post how important reading is for me, so I always read in the evenings as well. If there are two books I'm reading at a given point, I'm reading the easier one in the evening (e.g. when I'm reading fiction which happens sometimes, but not very often). I read until around 9:30-9:40 when I say goodnight to my roommate and meditate for 10 to 20 minutes. 

What does your evening look like (if you have one)?
