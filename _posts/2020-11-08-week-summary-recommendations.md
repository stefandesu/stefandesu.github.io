Do you remember my weekly update update posts? This will be kind of like those back in the day.

So it's been a full week of daily blogging for me now! So far it's going great I think. It's fun and I haven't yet run out of things to write about. I'm usually writing these posts a day in advance, so on the actual day, I only edit my draft and publish it before writing the post for the next day. This has taken some pressure out of this because even if I don't have enough time, I could still publish and catch up the next day. Not that that's going to happen now that we're back in lockdown though. ðŸ˜…

So what have I been writing about? It's mostly been catching up. After the [introductory post](/2020/11/01/nablowrimo/), I posted an [update about running](/2020/11/02/running-update/). I actually went for three runs this week with a total distance of 19 km. Good start I think. After an [admission that I'm spending too much time watching anime](/2020/11/03/too-much-anime/), I posted about my [morning routine](/2020/11/04/morning-routine/) and my [evening routine](/2020/11/05/evening-routine/). On Friday, I pre-ordered the iPhone 12 mini and made [a short post](/2020/11/06/iPhone-12-mini/) about that. And yesterday, I talked about [working hours and time management](/2020/11/07/working-hours-time-management/) which is something that will certainly come up again in these posts.

How did you like this first week of blog posts? Is it too much reading a post every day? Should they be shorter/longer? I think I'm just going to go with the flow and see where it leads me in terms of topics and length of posts.

As I mentioned in yesterday's post, I spend a little too much time on social media and stuff, so here are some things that I found throughout the week that I'd like to recommend to you (it's mostly going to be YouTube videos if I'm honest):

- Instead of wasting time talking about the US election, CGP Grey made a [video about hexagons](https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY) which I quite enjoyed. Hexagons are indeed the Bestagons.
- DJI announced the Mavic Mini 2 drone, and my favorite tech YouTuber [made a video about it](https://youtu.be/n0WCy1R6mIg). I've been talking to a friend about this who has the Mini 1 and I will definitely consider getting one as well, but only if I get back to making regular videos for YouTube. I can't justify this purchase if I don't actually make videos.
- My friend Igor, who lives in Tokyo, is posting somewhat regularly on YouTube and uploaded [a new video](https://youtu.be/C0kIXWfJhp0) this week. It's in German though.
- YouTube's algorithm suggesting [weird but funny videos](https://youtu.be/pXP2sgsfEPk) to me every time I dare to go to the home tab.

Some podcast recommendations:
- My friend recommended a podcast to me a while ago that I consequently plowed through and now I'm looking forward to new episodes every week. It's Roosterteeth's [F**kface Podcast](https://roosterteeth.com/series/f-kface) with Geoff, Andrew, and Gavin. Prepare to laugh your face off, but start with episode 1 otherwise you won't understand what's going on. [Here's](https://overcast.fm/+bqTwF2MEw) the introductory episode and you'll find links to several places where you can listen to it.
- I liked Yes Theory's recent podcast episode [How to Make a Change](https://yestheory.com/all-podcastss/how-to-make-a-change/) with Rich Roll.
- If you're into Apple stuff, I can wholeheartedly recommend [ATP](https://atp.fm) and [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected), two of my favorite podcasts in general simply because of the whole dynamic between the hosts. In this week's episodes, apart from usual follow-up and other random topics, they talked a lot about Apple's upcoming event next Tuesday where they will likely announce the first Apple Silicon Macs. I plan on writing a blog post about that after the event and explain why this all matters (assuming they actually do announce them).
- I enjoy listening to [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) occasionally and I liked the recent episodes with [Naval Ravikant (#473)](https://tim.blog/2020/10/14/naval/) and [Seth Godin (#476)](https://tim.blog/2020/10/26/seth-godin-the-practice/), as well as the rerun of [episode #221 (as #475) with Mr. Money Mustache](https://tim.blog/2017/02/13/mr-money-mustache/)

I really have to make notes about this throughout the week again. It's hard to figure out what you have watched/listened to after the fact. ðŸ™ˆ

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this beautiful Sunday!
