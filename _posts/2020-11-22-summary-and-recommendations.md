The third week of daily blogging is over! To be honest, I'm feeling the pressure of coming up with a new post every day, and I think you are feeling it as well, at least judging from the number of comments on my posts. ðŸ˜…

I started the week with a post about [my Japanese studies](/2020/11/16/japanese-studies/). I'm sure there will be updates about this in the future. On Tuesday, I went back to the past and wrote about [my abandoned YouTube channel](/2020/11/17/abandoned-channel/) that I started in 2006. On Wednesday, I talked about [my plans for my meditation time app Nodoka](/2020/11/18/nodoka-update-ideas/). On Thursday, I dove back into the hot topic in the Apple world right now, [M1 Macs](/2020/11/19/m1-macs-roundup/). I promise there won't be another post about it this month. ðŸ™ˆ On Friday, I talked about [having too much input](/2020/11/20/too-much-input/) and being overwhelmed, and yesterday I wrote about the [voice inside your head](/2020/11/21/the-voice-inside-your-head/). I hoped that this last post would stir up some discussions, but maybe y'all are to busy right now. ðŸ˜…

If you have any ideas for topics I can write about that don't require a ton of time (remember, I'm writing one of these a day), please let me know! Of course I have more things that I'd like to talk about, but all of those are longer posts that I won't be able to write during these daily blogs.

Not too many recommendations for this week:
- Related to my Too Much Input post, Nathanial Drew posted a [video about quitting social media for 30 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHE1cJF3OZs).
- For those who watched Tenet, you should watch this [Tenet inspired video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSBtysVymnU).
- I randomly stumbled upon this fascinating [FPV drove video of the Matternhorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqgvRIUffI).
- [Dumbledore asked calmly](https://youtu.be/IdoD2147Fik)
- Peter McKinnon made a [really cool video](https://youtu.be/_MLFSX5cpmE).

Have a nice Sunday, everyone!
