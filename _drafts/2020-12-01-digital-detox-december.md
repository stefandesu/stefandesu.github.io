A few days ago, I stumbled upon someone on Reddit (ironically) suggesting a Digital Detox December. Since I've been spending an increasing amount of time on social media recently, I was intrigued to try this. I also don't think I ever tried a whole month of something like this.

Of course, such a challenge is very specific to the individual, and I'm not going 100% on all the things. In this post, I will outline the rules I'm setting for myself.

## Instagram
No Instagram for the whole month.[^1]

## YouTube
No watching YouTube for the whole month, except for videos that my friends made and sent to me.

## Reddit
No browsing Reddit for the whole month. However, I am adding an exception for episode discussion threads of anime that I'm currently watching.[^2]

## Twitter
No Twitter, except for posting about new blog posts via the website.

## Facebook
I'm only adding Facebook because people will think "What about Facebook?" While I still have an account[^3], I don't use it at all, so no change necessary.

## Other Blogs/News (e.g. RSS)
Over the last few months, I started to slowly integrate RSS feeds into my life, especially for some technology blogs. While I will also not look at these, I'm planning to use RSS feeds in the future to get away from using some services directly so that I don't fall into a rabbit hole (like on YouTube).

## Podcasts
I talked about this with a friend today. I have a small number of podcasts that I absolutely love, and I will continue to listen to those shows. I can literally count them on one hand: Connected, ATP, F**kface, Cortex, Hello Internet. The last two post on a very irregular schedule, so it's three and a bit episode per week.

## Anime and Other Media
You may have read my post about [watching too much anime](). Well, I have realized that it is a little bit too much, but since we are approaching the end of the season, I will finish the anime that I'm currently watching. I will also start watching Attack on Titan since I am very excited about it (I think the first episode is coming out on Sunday). Also, I am watching some shows with my roommate which I will continue to do. Basically no change here.

## Messaging
I kept the hardest part for last. While I don't strictly consider messaging as social media, I often catch myself obsessively opening my messaging apps when I'm on my phone. So I will implement two measures to deal with this:

1. I will keep my two most used messengers, Signal and Telegram, on my phone, but I will disable all notifications and restrict usage of these to a certain time in the day. I enjoy our group chats and still want to participate in them, but I want to make sure not to check too often and to restrict the time I spend in those apps. Right now I'm thinking about 15 minutes in the late afternoon.
2. I will move all other messengers (I have too many) to my old phone and check it only once a week.

I am hoping that this will be enough to not be out of touch, but at the same time keep me more focused in the moment outside of the times I allow myself to check. It's hard for me to estimate how much time I spend in messaging apps since I used them on three different platforms, but restricting it to one platform (my phone) and to a certain time of day will definitely reduce that amount of time.

For everyone reading this that needs to get in touch with my quickly, there will be only one way: Call me on my phone number.

[^1]: Since I use Instagram as a messaging app as well, I will install the app "Threads" which is kind of like "Instagram Messenger."
[^2]: It is possible to create RSS feeds for search queries on Reddit, so I will set up a system so that I get to the threads directly without having to browse r/anime for them.
[^3]: I was planning to delete the account in November, but I'm postponing this to early 2021 because I'll need to go through my friend list and message a few people that I only have on Facebook.
