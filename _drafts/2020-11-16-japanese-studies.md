title: How I Study Japanese (And What I Would Like to Change)

One of the recurring themes on my blog and YouTube channel is Japan and the Japanese language. I've been an anime fan since forever, had two long Japan stays, and have been studying Japanese actively for about 4 1/2 years now.[^1]

In today's post, I would like to tell you about how I currently study and what I would like to change about it.

## How I Study Currently
Admittedly, there is not too much to say here. "Actively" in this case means that I have a fixed block in my morning routine where I review my vocabulary and kanji in an app called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). I am planning to write a separate post about Anki in the future.

The thing is: I haven't added new cards to my Anki decks in a while. So while I'm reviewing everything I've learned so far, I'm not learning new things, at least not in Anki. That's why it takes me only 5 to 10 minutes to complete all my reviews, even though I have a whopping 1214 kanji and 2700+ words in my decks.[^2] This shows the power of spaced repetition: If you do it every day, and you are using a good algorithm (which is Anki's specialty), you can keep a ton of information in your head with minimal long-term time commitment.

Something that I wouldn't consider "studying", but that certainly doesn't hurt, is watching anime and shows. I'm watching [a ton of anime]() and usually watch one episode of Terrace House[^3] with my roommate in the evening. While there are always English subtitles, I'm trying to actively listen to the Japanese as well. Especially with Terrace House, I can often supplement the subtitles with additional information for my roommate, as subtitles don't always accurately represent what was actually said.

Sadly, this is all I can say about this part of the post...

## What I Would Like to Change
I'm still very much interested in improving my Japanese and someday get to a level that allows me to watch things in Japanese without English subtitles and to have a normal conversation with a Japanese person. Interestingly, I feel like I'm ahead in the conversation part compared to the understanding part, at least that's how it felt during my last trip to Japan.

So there are certain things that I would like to integrate into my Japanese studies:

### Learn New Vocabulary and Kanji
Whenever I try to watch or read something in Japanese, I notice that especially vocabulary is a problem for me. I want to be more mindful of what I'm actually missing and learn those things.

### Study grammar from the beginning
Out of all the different parts of a language, I feel like my grammar is comparatively bad. In 2016 when I went to Japan for my exchange, they put me into level 4 of 6 because I had studied Japanese a few years earlier. However, at that point I had forgotten almost everything, so I only had a few weeks to catch up to the rest of the class. While I was kind of able to catch up with vocab and kanji (I was kind of the kanji master at the end of the semester), my grammar was still lacking, and I never spent the time to actually deal with that. So what I want to do is to start from the basics and work my way up. Of course there will be a lot that I already know. I'm pretty sure I could easily pass JLPT N5 if I took it tomorrow. But even with N4 grammar, I'm not sure if I know all of it. The course I took during my exchange worked towards N3, so I should know most of N3 grammar, at least somewhat. And I'm pretty sure I know almost no N2 grammar. (I think that's where I will stop because from what I've heard, N1 grammar is super obscure and you won't really need it in daily life.)

### Read Japanese Books
I own some books that I brought with me from Japan. The problem is that while they are not impossible for me to understand, they are quite above my current level, so trying to read them it fairly exhausting. So maybe after I nailed down some of the grammar stuff, I would like to try again, knowing that it will be hard. I might need to block certain periods of my day specifically for reading Japanese books. But if I actually do, I think it can really help with my Japanese.

### Find a Tandem
Something that I pretty much never really tried is to find a tandem partner to exchange language with. Especially for conversation, this would be a big step. I'm not sure about doing it online though, so I might postpone this until it's okay to meet in person again.

### Watch Some Stuff Without Subtitles
I think I want to keep the English subs for most of the things that I watch, especially if I really care about understanding everything that's going on. But I have a few anime on my list that might be closer to my level of Japanese, so I want to try watching these with Japanese subtitles. There are actually sites and tools that help you use this to study Japanese by providing mouseover translations and stuff. Definitely something to look into.
